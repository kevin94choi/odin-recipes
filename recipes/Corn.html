        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you want to make the easiest corn on the cob, here's something I've known for years â€” no matter how great a kitchen technique is, unless you use it regularly, you'll forget about it! This technique for making corn on the cob works perfectly, and I hope you give it a try soon.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ear fresh corn, in the husk</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon butter, or more to taste</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                    <li>Microwave ear of corn on high until cooked through and tender, about 3 1/2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Transfer ear to a cutting board. Hold the tapered end with a towel and cut 1 inch off the bottom of the thick end. Squeeze the tapered end until the ear comes out of the husk and silk.</li>
                    <li>Spread butter over corn and season with salt.</li>
            </ol>
